Sure, I can help you create a detailed outline for a course on SQL (Structured Query Language) for your students. Here's a suggested plan:

1. **Introduction to SQL**
    
    - What is SQL and why it is used
    - Different types of SQL databases
    - Setting up a SQL development environment
    
2. **Database Management**
    
    - Creating and modifying database structures
    - Designing database schema
    - Creating and managing tables
    - Defining relationships between tables
    - Creating and managing indexes for improved performance
    
3. **Data Manipulation**
    
    - Inserting data into tables
    - Selecting data from tables
    - Filtering and sorting data
    - Updating and deleting data
    - Using aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)
    
4. **Querying Data**
    
    - Selecting data from multiple tables with JOINs
    - Using subqueries
    - Understanding NULL values and three-valued logic
    
5. **Data Transactions**
    
    - Understanding ACID properties
    - Managing transactions and locks
    - Rolling back and committing transactions
    
6. **Advanced SQL Topics**

7. **Best Practices and Common Pitfalls**
    
    - Common SQL antipatterns
    - Writing efficient SQL queries
    - Using SQL in real-world applications
    

This plan should provide a comprehensive overview of SQL, from the basics to advanced topics. You can adjust the content and depth of each section based on your students' needs and background.
